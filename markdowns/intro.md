We used a google form to collect data from you (ahem! ahem! Data Science again!!) and we encountered following issues:

- [x] Around 70% of the students haven't used python.
    * **No issue we have decided to put a seprate session for python exclusively.** 
    
    * **Yes we know we are awesome! but thanks anyways.**

- [x] People have near to zero knowledge of discrete mathematics:
    * **If numbers make sense to you in the way Game of Thrones makes then you are a rockstar dude. God Speed to you.**

    * **If they don't then don't you worry we will work things out. There is always a first time my friend.**

- [ ] People are tired of this cold weather:

    * **Oh c'mon already winters are fun.**

### __What are we going to accomplish in the bootcamp:__

1. __Let's bury the hatchet with python once and for all:__

    - Python is fun guys and we will teach you the fun way.

    - One day complete session only for python:

        * What's different in python?
        * What are variables and these so called data types?
        * Python Sytanx and why it's a big deal
        * Functions in Python 
        * Operations, Conditional Statements and Sequences
        * Advanced Python Tools (God Bless Us)

2. __Let's move on to working on libraries of python:__

    - __Life played with us and now we play with python__ 

        - Intro to Numpy
        - Intro to Pandas
        - Intro to Matplotlib
        - Intro to Sea Born (Hopefully)
