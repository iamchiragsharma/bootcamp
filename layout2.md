We used a google form to collect data from you (ahem! ahem! Data Science again!!) and we encountered following issues:

Around 70% of the students haven't used python.
>No issue we have decided to put a seprate session for python exclusively. 

>Yes we know we are awesome! but thanks anyways.

People have near to zero knowledge of discrete mathematics:
>If numbers make sense to you in the way Game of Thrones makes then you are a rockstar dude. God Speed to you.

>If they don't then don't you worry we will work things out. There is always a first time my friend.
